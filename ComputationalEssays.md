# Computational Essays on Artificial Intelligence

This is a collection of essays meant to be computational executed. More details about this project can be found in the [README](./README.md).

Each of the following Jupyter Notebooks is designed to be read and executed either by itself, or in combination with the other essays. You can read and execute in the following order, or jump around between them, following a path of your own interests. The essays are designed to be read and executed interactively.

## Braitenberg Vehicles

* [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Braitenberg_Vehicles.ipynb) 
* [Launch in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/HEAD?filepath=notebooks/Braitenberg_Vehicles.ipynb)
* [Launch in Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Braitenberg_Vehicles.ipynb)

Topics covered include simple `Robot control`.

> This essay explores some of the vehicles described by Valentino
Braitenberg in his book entitled *Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic
Psychology*. Although this essay doesn't explore Machine Learning, it
does offer some insight into how an agent's behavior could be tightly
coupled with its environment.

## What is it like to be a robot?

* [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/To_be_a_robot.ipynb)
* [Launch in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/HEAD?filepath=notebooks/To_be_a_robot.ipynb)
* [Launch in Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/To_be_a_robot.ipynb)

Topics covered include `Philosophy of mind`, `Embodiment`, `umwelt`.

> Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked "What is it like to be a
bat?" In this essay, we explore the question "What is it like to be
a robot?" Here, you explore first-hand what it is like to sense the
world from a robot's perspective, and make your way through a
simulated world.

## Evolving Robot Control

* [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/EvolvingRobotControl.ipynb)
* [Launch in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/HEAD?filepath=notebooks/EvolvingRobotControl.ipynb)
* [Launch in Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/EvolvingRobotControl.ipynb)

Topics covered include `Genetic Algorithm`, `Robot control`.

> In this essay, we explore the Genetic Algorithm to evolve a Robot control neural network that allows a robot to move about in a simulated environment.

## Structure of Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Structure_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.ipynb)
* [Launch in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/HEAD?filepath=notebooks/Structure_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.ipynb)
* [Launch in Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Structure_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.ipynb)

Topics covered include `Convolutional Neural Networks`.

> In this essay, we deep-dive into the functioning of a Convolutional Neural Network.

## Robot Memory

* [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Robot_Memory.ipynb)
* [Launch in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/HEAD?filepath=notebooks/Robot_Memory.ipynb)
* [Launch in Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Robot_Memory.ipynb)

Topics covered include `Memory`, `Embodiment`.

> Does a robot need memory at all? Maybe not. In this essay we explore the idea that a robot can learn to use the world as its memory.

## Programming a Chess Player

* [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Programming_a_Chess_Player.ipynb)
* [Launch in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/HEAD?filepath=notebooks/Programming_a_Chess_Player.ipynb)
* [Launch in Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Programming_a_Chess_Player.ipynb)

Topics covered include `symbolic computation`, `static analysis`.

> In this essay, we build a chess-playing program.
