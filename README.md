# aitk: Artificial Intelligence Toolkit

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/339135763.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/339135763)

This collection contains two things: an open source set of Python tools, and a set of computational essays for exploring Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics. This is a collaborative effort started by the authors, building on almost a century of collective experience in education and research.

The code and essays are designed to require as few computing resources as necessary, while still allowing readers to experience first-hand the topics covered.

## Computational Essays

Each computational essay is described at [Computational Essays](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/ComputationalEssays.md). Our computational essays and a suggested sequencing through the notebooks can be found in the [notebooks folder](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/tree/20973e79b6d33a1e3e6d829f5f7eec127afd65c7/notebooks&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1721761109108242&usg=AOvVaw3mMyxhFeq1HBWdlFDU_lAv) of this repo.

## Artifical Intelligence Toolkit

`aitk` is a Python package containing the following modules.

* [aitk]() - top level package
  * [aitk.robots](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/tree/master/docs/robots) - for exploring simulated mobile robots, with cameras and sensors
  * [aitk.algorithms](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/tree/master/docs/algorithms/) - for exploring algorithms
  * [aitk.networks](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/tree/master/docs/networks/) - for constructing and visualizing Keras deep learning models
  * [aitk.utils](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/tree/master/docs/utils/) - for common utilities
