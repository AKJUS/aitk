# Computational Essays on Artificial Intelligence

This is a collection of essays that are meant to be computationally executed. More details about this project can be found in the [README](./README.md).

Each of the following notebooks contains both explanation and code and are designed to be read and executed interactively to test out the concepts being explained. You can explore these notebooks in any order depending on your interests. 

## Understanding Neural Networks 

#### Basic Neural Nets

Topics covered include an `introduction to neural networks` and `machine learning`.

> This essay explores a small dataset of handwritten digits. You will build and train a simple neural network to correctly classify the digits 0-9, and see its limitations when applied to noisy images.

#### Categorizing Faces

Topics covered include `supervised learning` and `visualizing weights`.

> This essay explores the faces dataset created in conjunction with Tom Mitchell's 1977 book entitled *Machine Learning*. After training the network to recognize whether a person is wearing sunglasses or facing a particular direction, you will visualize what aspects of each image the network has learned to focus on to correctly classify the image.

#### Analyzing Hidden Representations

Topics covered include `hidden space` and `Principal Components Analysis (PCA)`.

> This essay returns to the small dataset of handwritten digits covered in the notebook on Basic Neural Nets. Here, you will visualize the hidden layer representations prior to training and after training using Principal Components Analysis.

#### Data Manipulation

Topics covered include `composition of data` and `biased outcomes`.

> This essay explores how the composition of the training data can lead to biased outcomes. It focuses on a subset of a larger dataset of handwritten digits from MNIST. By manipulating the numbers of 4's vs 5's in the dataset, it demonstrates that when the imbalance is large enough, the network struggles recognizing the underrepresented class. 

####  Structure of Convolutional Neural Networks

Topics covered include `Convolutional Neural Networks`.

> In this essay, we deep-dive into the functioning of a Convolutional Neural Network that is designed for processing two-dimensional image data.

## Robotics

#### Braitenberg Vehicles

Topics covered include simple `Robot control`.

> This essay explores some of the vehicles described by Valentino
Braitenberg in his book entitled *Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic
Psychology*. Although this essay doesn't explore Machine Learning, it
does offer some insight into how an agent's behavior could be tightly
coupled with its environment.

#### What is it like to be a robot?

Topics covered include `Philosophy of mind`, `Embodiment`, `umwelt`.

> Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked "What is it like to be a
bat?" In this essay, we explore the question "What is it like to be
a robot?" Here, you explore first-hand what it is like to sense the
world from a robot's perspective, and make your way through a
simulated world.

## Components of Large Language Models

#### Word Embedding

Topics covered include how `word embeddings` are learned.

> This essay explores how a rich representation of a word's meaning can be inferred soley from its associations with other words. A stripped down language with just 27 words and a limited set of templates is examined.
