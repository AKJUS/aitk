# aitk: Artificial Intelligence Toolkit

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/339135763.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/339135763)

This collection contains two things: an open source set of Python tools, and a set of computational essays for exploring Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics. This is a collaborative effort started by the authors, building on almost a century of collective experience in education and research.

The code and essays are designed to require as few computing resources as necessary, while still allowing readers to experience first-hand the topics covered.
