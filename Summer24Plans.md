# Getting started the first week
* 3Blue1Brown channel, watch videos that introduce neural networks
* The latest version of tensorflow has broken some aspects of aitk
* Have students go through and try every notebook to see what works and what doesn't
* Have them start to look throught he code base for how it is orgainized

# Managing an open source project

* Create a README with our developer conventions
* Using issue tracker in github
* Providing type info
* Testing
* Can't push without a review first
* Documentation
* How to know when it is ready to release

# Reorganization of the GitHub repo

* Consider ways to best indicate different types of notebooks.
* Some are more introductory, others are more advanced.
* Incorporate latest notebooks used in Ethics class into the repo.
* Should an ordering be suggested?

# Deliverables

* All students must write a short summary of their summer project (1 page)
* We will create a poster for the Sigma Xi Fall Poster Session
* We may want to submit our work to SIGCSE or FLAIRS

# Overall guiding concept

* We want to build micro versions of imporant AI algorithms to allow non-experts to better understand them and develop the right intuitions about their strenghs and weaknesses.

# Understanding what an artificial neuron computes

* An interface for manipulating
  - weights
  - bias
  - inputs

to see how these all affect the outputs generated


# Word Embeddings

* Create a simple grammar to generate a data set of sentences.
* Use these sententences to create a word embedding.
* Explore how the representations created by the network are related.


# Dataset Manipulation

* Find or create a classification dataset.
* Show how manipulating the class representation within the training set affects the bias within the results.


# Transfer Learning

* Using an existing front end, like image net, to train a new classification task, this already exists in the convolution notebook that Jim created


# Generative AI

* We will need to look into the best ways of accomplishing this
* May need to use pytorch
* Would be nice to be able to visualize the attention head


# Reinforcement Learning

* Perhaps applied to a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe
