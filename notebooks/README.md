# Suggested Sequencing

This is our suggested order for reviewing notebooks. For more information on content of the notebooks, please visit [Computational Essays](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/ComputationalEssays.md).
Depending on skill-level and prior knowledge, feel free to go in whatever order makes the most sense to you, however, if you are looking for 
a guide on how to navigate this repo, please see our outline of sequencing below:

## By Topic:
If you have never used a notebook before, please review our notebook **[Intro To Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/IntroToJupyterNotebook.ipynb)**.

### Understanding Neural Networks 
#### Begin with:
>**[Basic Neural Nets](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/NeuralNetworks/BasicNeuralNets.ipynb)**

#### Next:
>**[Categorizing Faces](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/NeuralNetworks/CategorizingFaces.ipynb)**
>
>**[Data Manipulation](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/NeuralNetworks/DataManipulation.ipynb)**

#### Finally:

### Components of Large Language Models
If you have not already, review the **[Basic Neural Nets](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/NeuralNetworks/BasicNeuralNets.ipynb)** notebook 
and **[Analyzing Hidden Representations](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/NeuralNetworks/AnalyzingHiddenRepresentations.ipynb)** notebook before continuing on with this sequence.

#### Begin with:
>**[Word Embedding](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/GenerativeAI/WordEmbedding.ipynb)**

#### Next:
>**[NanoGPT](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/GenerativeAI/NanoGPT.ipynb)**
