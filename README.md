# aitk: Artificial Intelligence Toolkit

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/339135763.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/339135763)

This collection contains two things: an open source set of Python tools, and a set of computational essays for exploring Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics. This is a collaborative effort started by the authors, building on almost a century of collective experience in education and research.

The code and essays are designed to require as few computing resources as necessary, while still allowing readers to experience first-hand the topics covered.

## Computational Essays

Each of the following Jupyter Notebooks is designed to be read and executed either by itself, or in combination with the other essays. You can read and execute in the following order, or jump around between them, following a path of your own interests. The essays are designed to be read and executed interactively.

1. [Evolving Robot Control](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/EvolvingRobotControl.ipynb) - topics covered include `the Genetic Algorithm`, `Robot control`
2. [Structure of Convolutional Neural Networks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk/blob/master/notebooks/Structure_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.ipynb) - topics covered include `Convolutional Neural Networks`

## Python tools

`aitk` is a virtual Python package containing the following modules.

* [aitk]() - top level virtual package; install this to get all of the following
  * [aitk.robots](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk.robots/) - Python package for exploring simulated mobile robots, with cameras and sensors
  * [aitk.algorithms](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk.algorithms/) - Python package for exploring algorithms
  * [aitk.networks](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk.networks/) - Python package for constructing and visualizing Keras deep learning models
  * [aitk.utils](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk.utils/) - Python package for common utilities

In addition, there is a related repository for large datasets:

* [aitk.datasets](https://github.com/ArtificialIntelligenceToolkit/aitk.datasets/) - repsoitory for large datasets for use in above Python packages
